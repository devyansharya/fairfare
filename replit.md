# Fairfare - Cab Price Comparison Application

## Overview

Fairfare is a modern web application that allows users to compare cab prices across different ride-sharing services. The application features a sleek black and yellow design theme and provides users with the ability to search for rides, compare prices, and earn points through their usage.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state
- **Routing**: React Router DOM for client-side navigation
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive shadcn/ui component system with Radix UI primitives
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript (ESM modules)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-based sessions with connect-pg-simple
- **Development**: Hot reload with Vite middleware integration

### Database Layer
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon serverless)
- **Schema Location**: `/shared/schema.ts` for shared types between client and server
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- Simple user authentication with username/password
- PostgreSQL-backed user storage
- Shared user types between frontend and backend
- Points-based reward system integrated into user profiles

### Search and Comparison Engine
- Location-based search functionality (pickup and destination)
- Date/time scheduling for future rides
- Mock data integration for cab services comparison
- Real-time price comparison display

### UI/UX Features
- Dark theme with yellow accent colors
- Responsive design optimized for mobile and desktop
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Loading states and error handling
- Comprehensive form validation with React Hook Form

### Storage Layer
- Abstract storage interface (`IStorage`) for flexibility
- In-memory storage implementation for development
- Database-ready architecture for production scaling
- CRUD operations for user management

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users log in through the Login component, which stores user data and points
2. **Search Process**: Users input search criteria via SearchForm component
3. **Price Comparison**: Mock cab services are displayed through PriceComparison component
4. **Service Selection**: Users can select preferred cab services and are redirected to booking
5. **Points System**: Users accumulate points displayed in the PointsBar component

- Start command: `npm run start`
- Static asset serving from `/dist/public`
- Database migrations via `npm run db:push`

### Configuration Management
- Environment variables for database connections
- Separate development and production configurations
- TypeScript path aliases for clean imports
- Modular component architecture
